## Introduction
FPGAGameBoy (name subject to change) is an implementation of the GameBoy in Verilog. The aim of this project is to build a GameBoy which allows you to play in handheld mode or plugged on a TV with an HDMI cable, with the build-in buttons or by plugging a NES controller and by reading roms from SD card or by plugging original cartridges.

Although the goal of this project is not to be the most accurate emulator possible, I try to reproduce the real hardware the most I can. My priority is to make as many games as possible working.
